\begin{abstract}
Emergency vehicles frequently become delayed at intersections because of gridlock or timed traffic signals. As a result, the Emergency Vehicle could move more slowly or it might stay in its required place. A collision or a clog in the traffic might occur if the emergency vehicle ever tries to ignore the signal. Automated traffic control systems are suggested as a solution to this issue. A precise, cost-effective solution to save lives is what the system is built to do. The system uses smart objects to detect the siren of an incoming emergency vehicle, and it then stops traffic in other lanes of the junction to clear the way for the emergency vehicle to pass.


Traffic congestion delays are to responsible for 20\% of emergency patient deaths each year. More than 50\% of heart attack patients arrive at the hospital too late. The biggest problem is that nobody responds until the ambulance arrives, which makes it challenging for the ambulance to get where it needs to. In order to reduce these death rates. In today's society, traffic, as the primary worry, is causing several challenges in everyday life. Apart from the usual difficulties of congestion, it seriously impedes the proper operation of emergency vehicles. Emergency cars must be prioritized over all other vehicles, however due to unforeseen circumstances or self-centered motorists, emergency vehicles do not arrive at their destinations on time. The delayed arrival of emergency vehicles may endanger lives.

We Developed a hybrid application to book the closest ambulance in order to decrease the time needed to travel from the ambulance standalone area to the location of the rescue patient.

\section{Introduction}
The primary problem in today's society, traffic, is causing many issues for everyday living. In addition to the usual congestion problems, it seriously impairs the ability of emergency vehicles to operate normally. Emergency vehicles must be given priority over all other vehicles, but they frequently fail to arrive at their destinations on time due to unforeseen circumstances or selfish drivers. A life threat could arise from emergency vehicles arriving late. 
A technology that can identify the emergency vehicle before it reaches the intersection and clear the traffic in front of it must exist, it would seem. This may cut down on the delays and help the helpless in an emergency. In most nations, including India, there are sadly no effective actions done to address this issue. Therefore, emergency vehicles may either disregard the signal or continue to operate as usual. There is a considerable likelihood of accidents occurring if emergency vehicles override the traffic signal. IoT, which offers an effective way to handle these difficulties, is a result of recent technological advancements. Automated traffic control systems can help prevent the problems that emergency vehicles encounter.
Every lane of a given crossroads has one or more smart object(s) installed. These object(s) are made to detect the incoming emergency vehicle's siren, which activates a camera to take pictures. The camera then uses the photos to determine whether the vehicle is an emergency vehicle or not. The signal is sent to the Hybrid System if the car is recognized as an emergency vehicle. By detecting the lane that the emergency vehicle is entering, the Hybrid System can move traffic. The other signal lights at the intersection are all red.

Automation entails the substitution of material or mechanical components for people. These components or robots use artificial intelligence to do tasks that people do. Because of the heavy traffic in cities, ambulances cannot get at the location fast. In most countries, police escorts are used to create place for ambulances. Utilizing technology is preferred over expending human energy or effort. As a kind of technology, we use artificially intelligent systems. open a number of robotics programmed. Verbal commands and signals are used to signal the autos. Delays in traffic can lower the fatality rate. Systems might take the role of police escorts. Efficiency is increased by using AI for system control and obstacle avoidance. Utilizing AI technology reduces the demand for human.

The traffic must be cleared in front of the emergency vehicle using a mechanism that detects it before it arrives at the intersection. In an emergency, this might help people in need and save time. An intelligent traffic control system's primary objective is to minimise traffic-related delays by guaranteeing a smooth flow so that ambulances may get at hospitals on time. The traffic in Indian cities nowadays is one of the biggest problems. Despite the fact that there are more automobiles on the roads every day, the development of the city's infrastructure and roads has lagged behind expectations. The control of traffic signals is essential for avoiding gridlock.

 This paper suggests a unique intelligent traffic management system for a smart city. The suggested method not only directs ambulances to take the quickest routes to their destinations, but it also offers a preventative strategy to deal with the issue of the traffic signal system when it is compromised while it is in use. A simulated environment (the Cup Carbon simulator) is utilized to model different scenarios that depict the actual roads and vehicle movements in the implementation to demonstrate the proposed approach's benefits over other solutions.
Drawback: Directions, various priority levels for several situations, and scenarios can all be taken into account. The primary problem with IoT is that the overall security

 This paper assessed the literature on the pertinent approaches used to control traffic signals. This study contrasts various traffic signal management methods, including WSN, image processing, and RFID. The research in this paper shows that RFID is the most beneficial method for managing emergency vehicle traffic lights.
Drawback: RFID can generally only be read from a distance of 300 feet (90 meters), but many can be read from a distance of 1,500 feet (460 metres) or more thanks to the use of signal repeaters. This was more expensive than anticipated because we needed to install more hardware.

[6]\emph{ Ahmad Fauzan Kadmin , Siti Suhaila Jaapar Sidek ,Norlezah Hashim , Fakrulradzi Idris "Automatic traffic light controller for emergency vehicles using peripheral interface controller"}

This paper proposes a priority-based traffic signal controller for emergency vehicles that were programmed using a peripheral interface controller (PIC). Emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, can cause traffic light signals to automatically shift from red to green in emergency situations. When the ambulance has finished crossing the road, Radio Frequency (RF) technology will allow the traffic signal operation to return to normal. The design can respond within a range of 55 metres, according to the results. 
Drawback: of RF:
1. The range of the proposed system is too short for real-life situations.
2. Uncontrolled radiation of RF affects pre-adolescent children, pregnant women, elderly humans, patients with pacemakers, makers, and small birds.

This paper proposes a method that is applicable to detecting an emergency vehicle siren. With the installation of smart devices at the intersection and the use of long-range, low-power LoRa, the suggested method can be used to detect an emergency vehicle siren. The use of sound detection sensors allows for the eventual resetting of traffic signals after emergency vehicles have left the scene.
Drawback: The system can’t handle deadlock situations.

A static control system may impede emergency vehicles due to traffic congestion. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have drawn increasing attention because they can monitor traffic and reduce congestion on the roadways. Average waiting times (AWTs) for moving vehicles at intersections Researchers are increasingly using WSNs, RFIDs, ZigBee, VANETs, Bluetooth gadgets, cameras, and infrared signals to monitor real-time traffic. Modern priority-based signaling techniques are used in urban traffic management techniques to minimize the number of autos and congestion to recognize emergency vehicles utilizing WSN and multiple fuzzy logic controllers.
 Drawback analysis : Using PLCs and SCADA systems as subjects in intelligent transportation systems for efficient traffic flow might be quite intriguing.

This paper proposes a system that "provides a green way path" and turns all red lights into green in order to give clearance to any emergency vehicle. This technology will also follow a stolen car when it passes through a traffic signal in addition to the green wave path. Unlike other tracking systems, this does not require a  battery to operate. The global system for mobile communication (GSM), high-speed microcontrollers, and RFID technologies are used to do this.
Backdraw: The range of the proposed system is too short for real-life situations.

[11]\emph{M. Kalaivani, D. Shanmugapriya, G. Padmavathi
"A Study on Vehicle Detection and Tracking Using  Wireless Sensor Networks".}

The system uses three parts to find and follow moving things. The first part comprises low-cost, off-the-shelf wireless sensor gadgets, such as MicaZ motes, that can detect magnetic and auditory signals produced by moving objects. The data aggregation is carried out by the second component. Data fusion methods are handled by the system's third element. Real-time tests are necessary to determine whether a particle filtering method based on the Bayesian TBD estimator method is a promising candidate for target recognition and tracking with WSNs.
Drawback: It is resource-efficient yet has a large propagation delay.

Back Draws:  
Limitations of IR-based systems include 
1. Limited range and support for shorter ranges.
2. Be obstructed by regular items.

In:Smart Applications and Data Analysis.SADASC 2020.Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 1207,Springer.}

Since interoperability and performance are not currently being heavily considered in ITS middleware research, such an automated framework cannot be supported. In this article, the Bevor ITS middleware for emergency vehicle preemption based on NTCIP is proposed. Bevor accomplishes communication and data compatibility across most devices and equipment by employing NTCIP protocols in the communication layer. The efficacy of transmission was greatly enhanced by the use of NTCIP STMF. Bevor's Service Layer is built using the Web 3.0 architecture and XML interchange, making it simple to retrieve semantic data and perform operations like event detection, policy matching, and other similar tasks. 
Drawback: As opposed to the current technologies supported by languages, the technologies and tools utilized in this work are outdated, resulting in low accuracy and efficiency.

”,}

As the reasoning and video analysis both make clear, emergency response trips may be a serious threat to traffic safety. Such activities may be made safer and faster with VANET technology, perhaps saving lives in the process. VANET technology can transmit extra information on emergency vehicle positions, speeds, and routes to other traffic participants and infrastructure. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of such systems in larger networks, field tests and simulations are necessary. A 10\% equipment rate is typically considered the minimum needed. The applications described in this article would be instantly useful to any motorist who purchased an on-board unit for their vehicle if public authorities outfitted all emergency vehicles in an area with onboard units and all traffic signals with receivers and relays. 
Drawback : Prior to that, there were a few technical issues that needed to be resolved; these issues will be the focus of our ongoing effort. The system's security, privacy, and scalability are other issues that need to be addressed.

They have provided a thorough analysis of the current urban traffic management plans. To give an understanding of the objectives of urban traffic management, the primary difficulties with congestion control, average waiting time reduction, giving emergency vehicles priority, and the design requirements of intelligent traffic systems are explored. Despite the numerous research projects and outstanding advancements in traffic management systems over the past few years, there are still problems that need to be addressed.

[16]\emph{ Swarup Kulkarni, “.Intelligent Traffic Control System Implementation for Traffic Violation Control, Congestion Control and Stolen Vehicle Detection ”}

In this paper entire system is automated, fewer human interactions are necessary. When a stolen car is found, possible junctions are alerted by message notice sending and a ringing sign. Ambulances and other emergency vehicles must complete their missions as quickly as possible. if they devote a significant amount of their energy on clogged roadways. The activity flag changes to green as soon as the crisis vehicle is released, and the length of the crisis vehicle is still standing in the movement junction. Just after the emergency vehicle passes, the signal changes to red. Currently, the framework is actualized by considering one as the activity intersection's street. In the future, they might include ZIGBEE modules to the framework upgrades because they are so useful for arranging remote sensors.

[17]\emph{ Juhi R Srivastava, 2016, “Intelligent Traffic Management with Wireless Sensor Networks”}

The work that is being presented is an effort to reduce the average width between cars at a junction and make the junction adaptable to the current traffic density at the junction. The AWT at a junction can be reduced using strategies that have been described and evaluated using the Green Light District Simulator in this study (GLD). They get to the conclusion that, compared to the traditional strategy, our system is significantly more adaptable and effective. We can incorporate the simulation findings in a real-time WSN framework right now. They think that this approach might also result in fuel savings. Additionally, the Intelligent Traffic System and other technologies like RFID, GPRS, and GPS may be able to provide a traffic control system.

[18]\emph{ Sai Surya Prakash Moka1 “Real Time Density Based Traffic Surveillance System Integrated with Acoustic Based Emergency Vehicle Detection”}

Signal processing techniques are utilised to identify the presence of an emergency vehicle, and digital image processing techniques are employed to calculate the traffic density. The entire proposed system is depicted with appropriate schematics, and the final results are verified by hardware implementation. It starts with the acquisition of images and sounds, moves on to clever edge detection and noise removal using a Least Mean Square (LMS) filter, and then allocates green signals to the lanes based on the output results.

[19]\emph{ Deepthi L R ,Sarath Sasidharan,” Priority Based Real Time Smart Traffic Control System Using Dynamic Background”} 

This study presented an image processing-based priority-based traffic control system that will give all emergency vehicles high priority and enable them to pass through the traffic signal without incident. This enables them to quickly reach the emergency location and so save the lives of other individuals around. Based on pre-processing and image processing techniques, this is accomplished. In order to improve the detection, we want to incorporate more emergency vehicle attributes in a subsequent work.

[20] \emph{Dheeraj Dang∗ , Jitin Tanwar† and Sarfaraz Masood, “A Smart Traffic Solution for High Priority Vehicles”}

In this study, SUMO and TRACI were used to simulate traffic for high priority cars. SUMO is accessible through the TCP-based architecture used by TRACI. SUMO acts as a server and is in charge of setting up the simulation. An external component then takes over control of the simulation. The connection with SUMO must be opened and closed by the client. By turning the light green for the ambulance upon request, the model continuously assists the ambulance at all traffic junctions. According to the simulation findings, the suggested approach can significantly cut down on how long an ambulance needs to travel and can thus get there faster. Ambulance was highlighted in this study as an HPV.

In this research they simulate an intelligent transportation system at the microscopic level, where emergency vehicles broadcast specific information about their routes to passing cars and traffic signals. According to the investigation, broadcasting the route information can drastically shorten the time it takes emergency vehicles to respond. In some circumstances, the difference in travel time between emergency vehicles and non-priority vehicles might be as little as 37.1%.

 To get over VANETs' technological constraints and handle bigger ecosystems for emergencies, they provide a hybrid model. The hybrid model, which combines IOV with VANET, is able to get around communication barriers and offers emergency vehicles a safe and secure way to get to their destination. They evaluated the effectiveness of the V2V method and proposed a method using a hybrid model of IOV and VANET that uses the AODV and DSDV protocols. It has been determined that the proposed approach was superior way than the V2V method and has produced acceptable results based on the results from the four assessment criteria. The Proposed Method using the AODV protocol exhibits the greatest performance in terms of throughput, PDR, end-to-end latency, and bandwidth, according to the numerous simulations that were conducted.

In this paper, they implemented the PLC-Based Traffic Control System with Emergency Vehicle Detection and Management system. Initially simulated, then a prototype was tested. The prototype produced the intended results since the simulated outcomes completely matched the concept. The outcomes demonstrated that the emergency management algorithm is effective and has the capacity to maintain the system's status prior to the start of an emergency protocol. The technology may be used in real-world scenarios. Future development of the system might incorporate adaptive control into the timing sequence, allowing it to adjust the timing sequence of each route in reaction to the volume of traffic on each one, so enabling congestion control.

[24]\emp{Edmund Lai & Prakash Ranjitkar, Subash Humagain, Roopak Sinha, "A systematic review of route optimization and preemption methods for emergency vehicles" }

The strategies utilized to shorten EV reaction times have been outlined and contrasted in this paper. Although they still require significant improvements, optimization and pre-emption can help shorten response times. Researchers studying emergency management services are advised to concentrate on making optimization more dynamic by employing real-time dynamic traffic data and considering time as a crucial optimization parameter. Additionally, they must try to make pre-emption intelligent and take advantage of cutting-edge technology like VANET. Such preventative measures must guarantee that they have the least possible impact on other traffic. The most sophisticated optimization and pre-emption should be combined in future studies. Thus, the difficult task of lowering response time will be accomplished.

This paper examined a number of intelligent traffic management technologies. These included using smartphones, Green Wave Systems, RFID readers and tags, and wireless connectivity with Big Data centers. Each method's applications, benefits, and drawbacks were covered in concise summaries. IoT technology has been used to better efficiently and precisely collect data relating to traffic congestion. Additionally, a mobile application was suggested as a "User Interface" to identify traffic congestion in various locations and offer users detours. These methods are designed to provide drivers of moving vehicles with better knowledge about traffic and road conditions. Furthermore, Smart Traffic Systems could be used to assign emergency vehicles a priority.

[26]\emph{WEIQI YU , WEICHEN BAI AND LIANG QI , "State-of-the-Art Review on Traffic Control Strategies for Emergency Vehicles"}

According to this poll, emergency management service researchers should concentrate on using real-time traffic data to make optimum response times more dynamic. Furthermore, only one of the three strategies—which have only been evaluated in simulations and are challenging to implement commercially—is taken into account in the majority of recent research. To tackle the difficult task of reducing response time, future research should combine a variety of approaches. Future research should take into account other factors, such as the overhead of all vehicles, in addition to the objective metric focusing on the response time of EVs. As a result, there is a big opportunity and need for more thorough study to reduce the negative effects of EVs and conventional cars while still making a substantial contribution to emergency services. This study examines the most recent traffic management techniques to speed up reaction times when EVs are moving. It divides traffic management tactics into four categories: route optimization, signal preemption, lane reservation, and mixed traffic control tactics. Then, a comprehensive overview of the literature on traffic control methods using various algorithms is provided. 

[27]\emph{Farheena Shaikh , Dr. Prof. M. B. Chandak,  "An Approach toward Traffic Management System using Density Calculation and Emergency Vehicle Alert" }

In this research, IR and GPS-based approaches for traffic density estimation and emergency vehicle alarm are presented. Here, the two goals—first, determining the vehicle density on the road to ensure smooth traffic flow without congestion, and second, creating priority-based signaling to assist in giving emergency vehicles priority—are effectively examined. When correctly planned, implemented, and maintained, this traffic signal management strategy offers a number of advantages, including reduced congestion and reduced fuel usage. The suggested method will take into account not only the priority of the cars but also the density of the vehicles on the road and will also regulate the traffic signal sequence effectively and more correctly, with the GPS having more precision than a camera. By preventing traffic congestion and accidents, this system hopes to avoid wasting a lot of Human intervention hours that might be utilized to protect people and property. It can control priority emergencies. 
Flaw: Since the density of the vehicles varies from vehicle to vehicle, the information provided by the system could not be correct. This might not work in some scenarios.

In order to pass emergency vehicles without incident, this study provides an intelligent traffic control system. To scan the RFID tags affixed to the car, they employed an RFID reader, the NSK EDK-125-TTL, and a PIC16F877A system-on-chip. Additionally, it establishes network congestion and, consequently, the length of time that path has a green signal. If the RFID tag is from a stolen car, a message is transmitted through GSM SIM300 to the police control center. Additionally, an ambulance will signal to the traffic controller at the intersection to switch on the green light as it approaches the intersection. For wireless communication between the ambulance and traffic controller, this module employs ZigBee modules on the CC2500 and the PIC16F877A system-on-chip.

It addresses some of the issues with comparable technologies (such as strobe lights and MIRT) and will give emergency vehicles faster response times and more secure access to traffic signals. 
The ETL system could undergo a variety of improvements. Like entails incorporating a part into the system that will assist in gathering statistics whenever an emergency vehicle utilizes it.

}

This paper presents a brand-new platform and protocol with three primary systems called EVP-STC. The first system, referred to as the intersection controller, is deployed at traffic signals and gathers data on vehicle density and emergency vehicle location at every road segment leading up to an intersection. Based on the detected real-time traffic, the intersection controller then modifies the timing of the traffic lights. The second system, which has force-resistive sensors to detect automobiles, is deployed at each section of the road. It uses ZigBee to send the detected data to the intersection controller. To prevent emergency vehicles from having to wait at junctions, a third system is installed in them and sends GPS coordinates to the intersection controller. Simulation results show how successful the suggested platform is.
Draw back :Critical problems like deadlock cannot be handled by this technology.

\section{Developed System}
All emergency vehicles in India have preset siren sounds that have a consistent rhythm. Two tones of the siren sound are repeated. The tones, which are repeated every 1.3 seconds, are 960 Hz and 770 Hz. The Doppler Effect has an impact on the siren sound, which changes in frequency as the emergency vehicle moves. The suggested system comprises two phases of operation. The first part entails finding the emergency vehicle, and the second phase entails acting at the junction. The sound detection sensor, camera, and micro controller are all utilized by the system to process the data. The suggested system communicates using Lora technology. The smart object will hold a data collection of several emergency vehicle patterns that will be used to compare the present emergency vehicle with the data set. The smart item will have a camera attached, and it will be strategically placed to only record the necessary area of the route. 

The smart object initially recognizes an emergency vehicle on the road by: If the emergency vehicle is travelling in the direction of the signal, the smart object, which is situated 200 meters from the signal intersection, will recognize the emergency car's siren sound using a sound detection sensor. The smart object's next procedure involves comparing the moving item on the road to the data set that has been saved. As soon as the smart item hears a sound, the camera will be configured to start taking photographs of the moving cars on the road. Smart objects communicate with the Hybrid System located at the Signal Junction if both requirements are met. Making a choice is the second process. The Hybrid System will be built together with the signal junction. The smart items installed on the several roadways that will meet in the junction send signals to this system, which then receives them. The star topology will be used to organize all of the intelligent objects and Hybrid systems.

Hybrid application API : 

There will be an application for the ambulance. The ambulance driver can use that application to record the emergency case. When the ambulance approaches the signal, the visual processing will then be able to determine where it is originating from. All of the signals will be turned off and blocked from operating properly, with the exception of the one that the ambulance needs to pass through. The traffic signal control system will be connected to your application so that the entries may be stored in the database. Connect the image processing to the traffic signals as well. Additionally, we must learn how to manipulate signals. GPS Unit : Global System for Mobile Communication, sometimes known as GPS Module, is an acronym. Cellular technology that has been digitized is used to transmit voice and data services for mobile devices. A gadget called GPS is created particularly for following moving objects and pinpointing their where ab outs. the overall design of this system for information transmission and accident detection. GPS is used to identify latitude and longitude, while GSM is used to text the rescue team. Using EEPROM, the message receiver number is pre-stored. It also gives the option to block deceptive communications. Voltage is created when a piezo, an electronic device, is physically bent by vibration, mechanical strain, and sound wave.

AI – Deduction System Methodology :

Methodology of the AI-Deduction System Using cameras that are already present at the site as an input, the system can recognize the ambulance based on its image. This analyses the image that is updated in real-time using AI that has been trained to recognize the ambulance using a set of pretrained photos and compares them with the real-time data model to determine whether it is indeed an ambulance. A genuine ambulance is also connected to the system, and when it approaches, it sounds its siren to signal an emergency. We have an AI-based ambulance detection system that just uses the YOLO as a library, and we coupled the built-in features that the Yolo already has with the functionalities we wrote. Based on the packet's arrival and source address, the decision support system decides whether to clear the lane. The traffic signal is returned to normal operation after it waits for the sound-detection sensor to relay the message. 

Hybrid Application Methodology : 

The hybrid application also allows the ambulance driver to find the quickest route to the appropriate and closest hospital, saving both the patient's life and the driver's time. The hybrid was created using the React native language, along with certain front-end technologies including HTML, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. The back end was created using Graphql Yoga, and the database utilized was a Non-SQL database. It was released to the Play store. we have included the GPS module by utilizing Google Maps API Iconic to access Google to locate the ambulance in Real-Time by the hospital as well as by the Hybrid System. 

IOT Siren Detection System Methodology : 

LoRa has been used to connect the sensors and the gateway. Digital wireless data transmission using the LoRa (Long Range) protocol. A whole new wireless standard has been developed specifically for reliable, low-power communications. M2M and IoT networks are the main target markets for long range, or LoRa. Multiple apps running on the same network will be able to communicate with one another using this technology via public or multi-tenant networks. The most serious concerns facing our planet are addressed by smart IoT applications made feasible by LoRa technology, including energy management, resource conservation, pollution control, infrastructure efficiency, disaster prevention, and more. LoRa Technology, the IoT's core component, is what gives the world its intelligence. Some of its appealing features for IoT applications are long range, low battery consumption, and secure data transfer. The technology may be applied to public, private, or hybrid networks and has a larger range than cellular networks. A single LoRa gateway may control up to millions of nodes. Building a network is cheaper and easier to implement because the signals may be transmitted over great distances with minimal infrastructure. LoRa also has an adjustable data rate algorithm to extend the nodes' battery life and boost network capacity. The LoRa protocol offers a number of layers for secure communications, including encryption at the network, application, and device levels.

Algorithm used 1) Start 2) Listen for an emergency vehicle's sound 3) Set the camera if the frequencies are compatible. 4) Take a vehicle-filled photo of the chosen road. 5. Evaluate the picture against the data. 6) Send the HS a message if the car and an emergency vehicle are compatible. 7) The sender address is checked by HS when it receives the message from the smart object. 8) HS decides correctly by removing the requested smart item from the lane of travel. 9) Proceed to step 7 in the event that there is any new message from the same or other smart objects.

\section{Conclusion}
The technology is designed to address the most pressing issue of emergency vehicles being delayed owing to slow moving traffic or remaining stationed for an extended period of time. The suggested approach can identify the sirens of a police car, an emergency vehicle, or a firefighting vehicle. The reference articles reviewed during the literature study incorporated sensors in every vehicle, and a preset time period was established after the arrival of the emergency vehicle to revert back to regular operation, which has several drawbacks. The aforementioned difficulties are addressed in a cost-effective manner by putting smart objects at the junction and employing long-range, low-power LoRa.The cloud-based decision support system keeps track of traffic while also storing data there. This data may therefore be accessed and examined for potential future improvement. The storage system will dynamically expand the data's capacity in order to transition to a larger database, which should speed up access.Based on emerging technologies, the hybrid application's Ui may change in the future. We are able to construct an escort system for additional emergency vehicles, including a fire truck and a police car.
